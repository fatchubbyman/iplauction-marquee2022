#random (with probability)
#find a way to skip players that will be bought by other teams
#this is gonna be a big fckn nest of random numbers
#squads of 15
#retentions(maybe?)
#upload excel sheet(try to make python read it himself or ask chatgpt to make a list)
#squad of 15(3 all rounders,5 batsmen, 2wk, 5 bowlers)
#make rounds of maqruee players, .etc
#starting purse start from 90 cr/ after retention money
#to make probability using random, you can make the sample size more frequent,less frequently according to that you can make random more biased and all
#study 8 hours of ipl auction footage and draw conclusions about auction behavior and how teams manage new players and study auction strategies
#we have all seen how important having a good auction is to winning a tournament like the indian premier league, like kkr did and won by that margin
#use emojis to make your code look more playable
#every team has styles of auctioning, make tables on when what teams bid for what people and when they stop
#after all this code we would have an ai of ourselves after taking in training data from that footage

#have fun lmao
#we are making an ai with a number of binary statements which are numberized with different to proportions to reflect their chance of getting selected and our computer will make random choices off them
# you need to exactly know how this shit will start out and end
# learn how to append and extend lists properly
# parameters could be marquee players,players_that_xyz_likes
# make a function for every bidder
# make a function to display every player
# top bids of owners get 8/10 chances of bidding higher up for them
# medium bids get 5/10
# sluggish bids get 3/10
# before playing use this list to have an idea to get an idea of whos in whose set
